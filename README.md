# Android App: News App

## Project Information

### About

This was a project for my Android Basics Grow with Google Developer Scholarship program from Udacity. We were tasked to create a news app that would send network requests to the Guardian servers to retrieve back the latest news stories and display it for the user.

### Concepts

Networking and JSON parsing were to two primary concepts exercised in this application. The overall concepts used to design and build this app were:

- Connecting to an API
- Creating and sending network requests to servers
- Parsing retrieved JSON responses
- Running the network requests and work on a seperate background thread
- Using AsyncTask to manage and display the data
- Creating and managing custom objects to store the required data
