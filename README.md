# Android App: News App

## Project Information

### About

This was a project for my Android Basics Grow with Google Developer Scholarship program from Udacity. We were tasked to create a news app that would send network requests to the Guardian servers to retrieve back the latest news stories and display it for the user.

### Concepts

Networking and JSON parsing were to two primary concepts exercised in this application. The overall concepts used to design and build this app were:

- Connecting to an API
- Creating and sending network requests to servers
- Parsing retrieved JSON responses
- Running the network requests and work on a separate background thread
- Using AsyncTask to manage and display the data
- Creating and managing custom objects to store the required data

## User Interface

The UI houses a ListView containing the latest stories from the Guardian API. Each list item displays the news article title, date, category, and author(s). The user can select the number of stories they would like to see using the settings button.
